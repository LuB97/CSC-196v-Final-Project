                <h2 align="Center" >Data Analysis</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    From the data we have gathered, you can see that COVID-19 has spread through the United States at an
                    exponential rate. The logic behind its spread is social contact. You can see that at the beginning of
                    March there were very few cases of COVID-19 reported. This can be attributed by the low number of
                    testing available at the time. By the end of March there was a sudden extreme spike in the number of cases.
                    Testing availability has increased by then however the spread of the virus by unsuspecting individuals has
                    already done its damage. This then creates that exponential curve. It can also be observed that certain
                    states where the population is more dense, like in New York, the influx of COVID-19 is much higher
                    than more rural states such as Wyoming and North Dakota.
                </p>

                <h2 align="Center">Visualization</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>
                    How did you choose your particular visual encoding and interaction techniques?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    With the novel virus COVID-19 spreading at an exponential rate around the globe, we wanted to focus on
                    how it has been affecting us as a country in the Untied States. However, we know that each individual
                    has different concerns. For example, someone with family in New York for example would want to see
                    details in regards to that state. So with that taken into consideration, we decided to allow users
                    to be able to interact with the visual and select certain states that they wanted to expand details on.
                    We also wanted to show how each state compares to one another, so we decided to add a color gradient
                    based one of the big topics on COVID-19: total people tested.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices
                </h3>
                <p>
                    At first we had considered only showing the most recent data for each state. Then we would break out
                    the details for each state in a textbox as you hovered over the state of your choice. But then we
                    realized that the most recent data does not help to show people how quickly COVID-19 has progressed.
                    So we decided to add an additional visual that graphically shows how COVID-19 has progressed overtime.
                    We considered showing the over progression throughout the entire country, but we realized again that
                    it would be most beneficial to show the progression through each state individually. This way viewers
                    can more evidently see how quickly COVID-19 has spread in certain states. By showing the data as a
                    whole country, certain states with more spread would affect the overall curve therefore potentially
                    skewing how COVID-19 has affect states individually.

                <h3>
                    Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Bryant and I had spent about 2 hours each to go out and find the best dataset in regards to COVID-19.
                    Once we had gathered possible options we spent about 1 hour together deciding which sets of data would
                    be useful and how we would present the data in our visualizations. After that, we spent about 2 hours
                    for the data wrangling and deciding how to split up the data for our two visualizations. The HTML and
                    D3 set up took about 9 hrs each totaling to 18 hours in total for this. Our overall project took
                    approximately 23 hours to completely develop
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What aspects took the most time?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The most difficult aspects to develop was the D3 visualizations. It took quite some time for us to
                    get a handle on how to create the visualizations. The next difficult task was finding out how to use
                    two separate D3 libraries, since we had created two visuals but we were trying to load both onto a
                    single html page. Once we figured out all the little details it was not too difficult. Getting a
                    good flow to our page layout and making sure it was sensible and presentable was probably the
                    only other aspect that really took a lot of time to plan out.
